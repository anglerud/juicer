2:1 flavored syrup based on BRIX value
* 1 brix is just 1% sugar.
* So 2 * (juice - (brix / 100) * juice) - brix / 100 * juice - right?
* Scary found that the difference seen between ^^ and the calc on the Kevin Kos
  website is probably teh density of the juice. So need to have a list of juices
  and their density.  Get that from https://kg-m3.com/
  `sugar_in_juice = Wj * 0.01 brix`
  `rest_of_juice = Wj(1-0.01b)`
  sugar to addis (2 - 0.03b)Wj
  - ALSO take into account that density, and we're good. In the `sugar_in_juice`
    it'll be `sugar_in_juice = Wj * dentity_of_juice * 0.01brix`
